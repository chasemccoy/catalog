I am currently working on the Design Systems team at [Sprout Social](http://sproutsocial.com). My primary responsibilities are building and maintaining [Seeds](http://sproutsocial.com/seeds) (our design system) and Racine (our React component library).

In my role I focus on designing and building tools that enable our designers and front-end developers to work together more efficiently. A lot of this work manifests itself as collaboration with cross functional teams in order to help everyone speak the same language.
