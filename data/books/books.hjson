		description: If you read any book on this page, let it be this one. Have you ever read a story and felt as though it was somehow written about you? That's how I feel about *Perks*. It's heartbreaking, funny, and captures what it's like to grow up and navigate the world.

		title: Grid Systems in Graphic Design
		metadata: Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann
		description: There are tons of resources out there to learn about web design, but one of my favorite resources is classic graphic design books that focus on print. If you can learn the basics of grids in print design, you will have a design superpower in your toolbelt. This book is one of my favorite on grids (and design in general).

		title: Steal Like an Artist
		metadata: Austin Kleon
		description: I reread this book more often than any other. Austin Kleon is a constant source of inspiration in all mediums, but his seminal book on ceativity is a must-read. Short and to the point, he discusses how to absorb inspiration and turn it into something meanigful and productive. Plus, it's cheap cheap cheap. Buy this book.
