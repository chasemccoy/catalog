## Linting for product correctness

Inspired by [this tweet thread by Rafael Mendiola](https://twitter.com/GroundControl/status/1176512381519912961), where he describes the idea of creating custom ESLint plugin to enforce rules that help developers adhere to a design system.

It culminates in an example `eslint-plugin-design-system`:

And here's a good article on how to write custom ESLint plugins:

## Splash zones

In this case, a "splash zone" refers to the parts of a system affected by a change to the system. If I edit a component, what other components are affected?

Some devs at Shopify have built a `yarn splash` command that determines the splash zone of changes to their component library:

Their tools is conveniently open sourced:
