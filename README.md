This is my personal site/portfolio/blog/life catalog. 

Built using Gatsby, styled-components, styled-system, and hosted on Neflify. 

```
yarn start
```

Note: as of now you will need to have some environment variables for API tokens, etc. I use WordPress as a data source in Gatsby to manage and host my blog posts, so the site won't build unless you configure the appropriate keys.
